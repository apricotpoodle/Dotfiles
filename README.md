## How I manage my dotfiles

### Purpose

The idea is to keep all my dotfiles in the same folder.<br>
In this way, I can easily manage it with git / github to install it in a new computer.<br><br>

Moreover, I don't really like how Linux organize all dotfiles and apps installation. If you look into your `$HOME` folder, some of them are in `~/.config` directory, others in their own folder, and others like `.zshrc` in the `$HOME` directly.<br><br>

I use *DEBIAN 12 Bookworm* as an operating system.<br>
I use *gnome* as a window manager.<br>
I, not yet, use *TMUX* as a terminal multiplexer.<br>
I use *NEOVIM* as an editor.<br><br>

My workflow is pretty basic and I tend to not use my mouse. Even in Firefox thanks to the Vimium extension !
<br><br>

So, in the end, I created a simple folder called `Fab` in my `$HOME`.<br>
Inside it, there is my `Dotfiles` directory and all other folders I use every day. Everything is clean and my mind is in peace xD<br><br>

To deal with that and keep my dotfiles in the same folder, I use `stow`, which is a symlink manager.<br><br>

Here is the process if you want the same environment ! ðŸš€<br><br><br />

# Development Environment

:warning: _January 2023_ :warning:<br />
â–º only tested and approved on:

- Debian 12 Bookworm x86_64
<br /><br />

At first, this repo was for my own usage but I tried to comment every step so you can follow my instructions and take inspiration from my repo :blush:

I assume you start with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

I also assume you know basics of VIM like how to edit and save/quit :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Each step respect a specific order. Please respect same order !

The complete installation take around ~60 min depending power of the computer and your knowledges to understand what I am doing.

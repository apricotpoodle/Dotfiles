# Dotfiles

## How I manage my dotfiles

### Purpose

The idea is to keep all my dotfiles in the same folder.<br>
In this way, I can easily manage it with git / github to install it in a new computer.<br><br>

Moreover, I don't really like how Linux organize all dotfiles and apps installation. If you look into your `$HOME` folder, some of them are in `~/.config` directory, others in their own folder, and others like `.zshrc` in the `$HOME` directly.<br><br>

I use *DEBIAN 12 Bookworm* as an operating system.<br>
I use *gnome* as a window manager.<br>
I, not yet, use *TMUX* as a terminal multiplexer.<br>
I use *NEOVIM* as an editor.<br><br>

My workflow is pretty basic and I tend to not use my mouse. Even in Firefox thanks to the Vimium extension !
<br><br>

So, in the end, I created a simple folder called `Fab` in my `$HOME`.<br>
Inside it, there is my `Dotfiles` directory and all other folders I use every day. Everything is clean and my mind is in peace xD<br><br>

To deal with that and keep my dotfiles in the same folder, I use `stow`, which is a symlink manager.<br><br>

Here is the process if you want the same environment ! ðŸš€<br><br><br />

# Development Environment

:warning: _January 2023_ :warning:<br />
â–º only tested and approved on:

- Debian 12 Bookworm x86_64
<br /><br />

At first, this repo was for my own usage but I tried to comment every step so you can follow my instructions and take inspiration from my repo :blush:

I assume you start with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

I also assume you know basics of VIM like how to edit and save/quit :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Each step respect a specific order. Please respect same order !

The complete installation take around ~60 min depending power of the computer and your knowledges to understand what I am doing.

## If you install Ubuntu with VirtualBox

Here is few more steps if you start a fresh Ubuntu install with VirtualBox.

Log in as root user.

```sh
su
```

Add your user to 'sudo' group. In my case, my user is called 'flo'.

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G sudo flo
```

Install `sudo` package

```sh
apt install sudo
```

If you still have an issue like `you user is not in the sudoers file...`, you need to add manually your user.

```sh
su
```

```sh
sudo visudo
```

Write this line just after `Root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`.

```sh
flo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Close your terminal and re open-it.

<br />

Update/Upgrade packages, update snap packages and delete pre-install useless games, programs and tools.<br />
You need to close Firefox first and run those commands.

```sh
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo snap refresh firefox snapd snapd-desktop-integration && \
sudo apt remove -y thunderbird rhythmbox simple-scan shotwell remmina libreoffice-impress libreoffice-draw cheese \
aisleriot gnome-sudoku gnome-mines gnome-mahjongg gnome-todo gnome-todo-common && \
sudo apt autoremove -y && \
sudo apt autoclean -y
```

You also need to update version of `core` and version of `gnome` by going to Ubuntu Software tool (aka Snap Store).

To update `snap-store` itself, you need to first kill his process, then run `sudo snap refresh snap-store`.
